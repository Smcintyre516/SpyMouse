This website is made to forever remember the game Spy Mouse 
after those savages at Firemint murdered Spy Mouse, or to those
 close to him Mr./Agent Squeak. The game Spy Mouse was very close to my heart, it is how my uncle and I bonded.
So what right did those <b><i> evil corporate monsters </i></b> have to kill the game?!?!? The game Spy Mouse had great graphics, 
an amazing backstory, and quality gameplay, something EA can't say for most of their games! It had challenges, but 
they weren't so hard that you couldn't relax while playing the game. All of these memories thrown in the trash like 
they're nothing! How dare they!?!?!? But, this website is to remember all of the good memories we have had while playing Spy Mouse.
